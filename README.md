# 1. 
More Change
# 2. 
Using an interface to be used as a data type in a data structure to connect different Objects. Changing 3 ArrayList<Car>, ArrayList<Truck>, ArrayList<Van> 
to implement IDrive, where we can create instead of 3 seperate arraylists to ArrayList<IDrive>
# 3. 
Interfaces, overriding methods for dynamic polymorphism, inheritance
# 4. 
As many as we want
# 5. 
Needing to store different objects in an ArrayList<> under a common interface to make dryer code.

# 6. 
Composition in oop is having an object be a part of another object as an attribute
# 7.  
public class Car {
  private Engine engine;
  private GearBox gearBox;
  
}
# 8.
Composition is where objects  make up other objects. aggregation is objects being apart of another object.
# 9.
increases re-usability of code, increases testability of code, change member objects at run time to chagne behaviours of program
# 10. 
They get removed as well
# 11. 
they exist independently.
