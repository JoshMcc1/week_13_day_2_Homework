# 1. More Change
# 2. Using an interface to be used as a data type in a data structure to connect different Objects. Changing 3 ArrayList<Car>, ArrayList<Truck>, ArrayList<Van> 
to implement IDrive, where we can create instead of 3 seperate arraylists to ArrayList<IDrive>
# 3. Interfaces, overriding methods for dynamic polymorphism, inheritance
# 4.As many as we want
# 5. Needing to store different objects in an ArrayList<> under a common interface to make dryer code.

# 6. Composition in oop is having an object be a part of another object as an attribute
# 7.  public class Car {
  private Engine engine;
  private GearBox gearBox;
  
}
 #8.Composition is where objects  make up other objects. aggregation is objects being apart of another object.
 #9.increases re-usability of code, increases testability of code, change member objects at run time to chagne behaviours of program
 #10. They get removed as well
 #11. they exist independently.
